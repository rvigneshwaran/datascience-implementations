## Seaborn Histogram Examples

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook with various examples demonstrating how to create and customize histograms using the Seaborn library in Python. The dataset used for populating the histograms is a diversified dataset pre-built inside the Seaborn library. Each example showcases different options and parameters available in Seaborn for creating visually appealing and informative histograms.

## Getting Started
To run the notebook and explore the examples, follow these steps:

1. Install the required libraries: Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. Additionally, make sure you have Seaborn, Matplotlib, and other necessary libraries. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install seaborn matplotlib
```

1. Clone the repository: Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook: Open the Jupyter Notebook by navigating to the repository's folder and running the following command:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

1. Open the Histogram notebook: In the Jupyter Notebook dashboard, click on the `01-historgram-implementations.ipynb` file to open the notebook.
2. Execute the cells: Run each cell in the notebook to generate the histograms and visualize the various customization options.
